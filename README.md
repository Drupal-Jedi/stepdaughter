Stepdaughter project is a curated list of actual per-version patches for Drupal core and modules.

Sometimes it happens that important from your point of view patch stack in waiting of RTBC. 
Maybe. maintainer have vacations in Bali and has no chance to push it.

We are don't intended to replace Drupal.org patches workflow, all patches required to be placed on Drupal.org first.
